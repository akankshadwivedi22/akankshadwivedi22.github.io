	<p  style="color:white;">New York Fashion Week, held in February and September of each year, is a semi-annual series of events (generally lasting 7–9 days) when international fashion collections are shown to buyers, the press, and the general public. It is one of four major fashion weeks in the world, collectively known as the "Big 4", along with those in Paris, London, and Milan.[1][2] The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) created the modern notion of a centralized “New York Fashion Week” in 1993, although cities like London were already using their city’s name in conjunction with the words fashion week in the 1980s. NYFW is based on a much older series of events called "Press Week", founded in 1943.[3]

It has consisted of numerous branded events, such as Olympus Fashion Week New York[4] and MADE Fashion Week,[5] and many independent fashion productions around town.[6]

Producers of New York Fashion Week include IMG, The SOCIETY Fashion Week, FTL Moda in conjunction with Fashion Week Online, Style 360, Art Hearts Fashion, Style Fashion Week, and ASC Fashion week among others.[7][8] A centralized calendar of citywide events (including those affiliated with WME/IMG) is kept by the CFDA,[9] and was acquired from calendar founder Ruth Finley.[10] The economic impact of New York Fashion Week is estimated at $887 million</p>
